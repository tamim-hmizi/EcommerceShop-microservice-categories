# EcommerceShop Categories Microservice

Provides CRUD operations for product categories.

This service is one of seven Express/MongoDB microservices (auth, users, products, categories, carts, orders, favorites) that together form the backend of the EcommerceShop MERN application. Each service owns its routes under `/api/categories`, connects to MongoDB through Mongoose and exposes Prometheus metrics, so it can be built, deployed, scaled and monitored independently on Kubernetes.

## API endpoints

| POST | `/api/categories` | Create a category |
| GET | `/api/categories` | List categories |
| GET | `/api/categories/:id` | Get a category by id |
| PUT | `/api/categories/:id` | Update a category |
| DELETE | `/api/categories/:id` | Delete a category |
| GET | `/api/categories/metrics` | Prometheus metrics |

Data model: `Category` (name, description).
